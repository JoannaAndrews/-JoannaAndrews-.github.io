Official Blog Post for my Recent Project: Brain Tumor Classification and Segmentation with baseline models and CNNs

I developed several baseline classifiers and CNNS with the goal of building a classifier 
capable of distinguishing between non-tumor, pituitary tumor, meniongioma, and glioma MRI images

I utilized GridSearchCV() to optimize my baseline classifiers, and I attempted to understand
my CNN model's predictions by utilizing saliency maps to plot the most significant features identified by the model. My baseline
classifiers' performancers were also analyzed using Confusion Matrices.

This research endeavor achieved some interesting results, and I hope you check them out in my paper
(titled 'Brain Tumor Classification and Segmentation with baseline models and CNNs' and posted on this blog, hopefully :) ) 

I am currently working in integrating Transfer Learning models into this project, and I hope to build up this project as much as possible
in the future. 

Thank you for your support!! :)
